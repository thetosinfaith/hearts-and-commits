                <div class="message-body" id="messageContent" style="display: none;">
                    <p>I have never written a love letter, but it's weird; I feel like I know how to write. 😅</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I love your energy, Tade.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You already knew that, though. What I am really trying to say, and I only know how to say it the way I used to when I was on Bumble: I like like you. I have a crush on you. Thinking about you makes me giddy, and I get all excited when I hear you laugh.  😍</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have felt this way for some time now, but I really didn’t know how to say it or if I should. You see, I like you so much I don’t want to lose you. I kind of just want to be with you and around you as much as I can. I don’t want to tell you I have feelings and then make things awkward in our relationship. I like you too much to lose you over something silly like the romantic feelings not being mutual. ❤️</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Whether we are soulmates in terms of just being best friends or soulmates in terms of being in love with each other, I am honestly fine with either. Having you just as a friend has brought me so much love and joy, so thank you for touching my life in such a beautiful way. 🌟</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But let me explain myself a little more... You deserve to know and hear how truly amazing you are, and it is quite unfortunate that letters like this aren’t written to people more often.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>First, as you know, I think you are really funny, and I love that we can build off each other's humor. But it's not just about how smart and funny you are...</p>
                    <br>   
                    <p>I love how silly you are. You are fun, you make life fun. I love how you are just yourself: weird, silly, quirky, childish, and goofy. You don’t even need to try; you are just pure light. You are someone who fills me up with so much laughter. 😄</p>
